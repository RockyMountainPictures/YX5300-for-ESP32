<h1>YX5300 for ESP32</h1>

A library to support the YX5300 MP3 Module on the ESP32 platform. I created it because the other libaries did not work on my ESP32. It is in very early development, and I will add support for more controls + documentation in the near future.

Please refer to the example [simpletest.ino](https://github.com/bluejunimo/YX5300_ESP32/blob/main/examples/simpletest/simpletest.ino), [the manual](https://github.com/bluejunimo/YX5300_ESP32/blob/main/docs/Manual.pdf) and [YX5300_ESP32.h](https://github.com/bluejunimo/YX5300_ESP32/blob/main/src/YX5300_ESP32.h) for more information.
